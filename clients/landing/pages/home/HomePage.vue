        Hi! I'm Scott Erickson. I'm a loving husband, son, brother, cat-carer,
        and friend. My journey has taken me from growing up in New England to
        studying in Ohio, and now I call the San Francisco Bay Area home.

      <p class="mb-6">
        As a web developer since the days of IE6, I've seen the web evolve from
        its early days to the modern, dynamic platform it is today. When I'm not
        coding, you can find me pursuing various hobbies including woodworking,
        playing games of all kinds, cooking, and baking. I'm currently between
        jobs and also exploring the opportunities and challenges of AI for
        software development, business processes, and consumer products.
      </p>

        This site is my personal corner of the internet where I share my
        thoughts, projects, and experiences. Thanks for stopping by!

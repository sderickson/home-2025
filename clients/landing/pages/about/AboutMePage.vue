        Hi! I'm Scott Erickson. I'm a loving husband, son, brother, cat-carer,
        and friend. I grew up in New England, studied in Ohio, and now I call
        the San Francisco Bay Area home.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        For work, I've been a web developer since the days of IE6, and an
        entrepreneur since the great recession. I've seen the web ecosystem
        evolve dramatically, and cofounded
        <a href="https://skritter.com">skritter.com</a> and
        <a href="https://codecombat.com">codecombat.com</a>, and worked at
        <a href="https://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> on growth and platforms. When
        I'm not coding, I pursue various hobbies including woodworking, playing
        games of all kinds, cooking, and baking.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I'm currently between jobs and also exploring the opportunities and
        challenges of AI for software development, business processes, and
        consumer products. This site is part of that exploration!

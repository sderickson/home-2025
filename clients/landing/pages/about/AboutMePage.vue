            Hi! I'm Scott Erickson. I'm a loving husband, son, brother,
            cat-carer, and friend. I grew up in New England, studied in Ohio,
            and now I call the San Francisco Bay Area home.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            For work, I've been a web developer since the days of IE6, and an
            entrepreneur just as long. I've seen the web ecosystem evolve
            dramatically, cofounded
            <a href="https://skritter.com">skritter.com</a> and
            <a href="https://codecombat.com">codecombat.com</a>, and worked at
            <a href="https://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> on growth and platforms.
            When I'm not coding, I pursue various hobbies including woodworking,
            playing games of all kinds, cooking, and hiking.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            I'm currently between jobs and also exploring the opportunities and
            challenges of AI for software development, business processes, and
            consumer products. This site is part of that exploration!
